# Tool for creating malware datasets

**Author:** VÃ¡clav Korvas

The tool is used to automatically download malware samples from `bazaar.abuse.ch`, then analyze them using `tria.ge` and download the corresponding pcap files and reports. Whole folder with malware samples can be analyzed or just one malware sample. The samples can be also just send to the analysis without downloading the pcap file.

## Instalation
First you need to unzip the `dataset_creator.zip` file. On Linux, use the command `unzip dataset_creator.zip`. This will create a folder with the same name, with the source files, which you need to switch to. 

Next, using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` you need to install all the necessary packages. After that, the program can be run using `python3 triage_client.py <arguments>`.

Program was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and on Arch linux distribution.

## Usage
The main command is the `--all` command. This command downloads `n` number of samples for each family, then it will upload all the samples to the `tria.ge` for analysis.
And the it will download all the pcaps and overview reports as .json file.

Next command is `--submit` command. This command is for uploading single file or whole directory to the `tria.ge` for analysis. If whole directory is uploaded then `csv` log files are created. But if only simple file is uploaded no log files are created.

Command `--download` is used for downloading all pcap from `.csv` log file. This command only works if some `.csv` files were created using command `--submit`.

And last command `--get` is used to download `n` number of samples of specified family. 

```
Usage: python3 triage_client.py [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]

Commands:
    --help          Show this help message and exists 
    --submit	    Submit file or whole directory to tria.ge
    Options for submit:
        -d	Specifies directory with malware samples. (Can't combine with -f)
        -f	Specifies one malware sample. (Can't combine with -d)
        -o	Specifies output directory name for dowloaded pcaps

    --download	    Download all files from specified csv file 
    Options for download:
        -f	Specifies one .csv file.
        -o	Specifies output directory name for dowloaded pcaps

    --get	Downloads n malware samples of specified family
    Options for get:
        -m	Specifies malware family.
        -l	Specifies how many samples of given family we want.
        -d	Specifies output directory name for dowloaded samples

    --all	Downloads n malware samples of specified family and runs analysis and than stores the pcap files
    Options for all:
        -m	Specifies malware family. Or .txt file with malware family names each on new line of the file
        -l	Specifies how many samples of given family we want.
        -o	Specifies output directory name for dowloaded pcaps
        -d	Specifies output directory for malware samples.

Report files are automaticaly created. The file name is based on the input directory.
COMMAND arguments can't be combined.

## Examples
Here are some usage examples.
All these individual examples consist of 3 part:
* First is shown the content of the folder before the command is executed.
* Command execution and output.
* Folder content after the program was executed.
```
Download malware, then upload to tria.ge and download pcaps
