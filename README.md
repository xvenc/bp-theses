# Tool for creating malware datasets

**Author:** VÃ¡clav Korvas

The tool is used to automatically download malware samples from `bazaar.abuse.ch`, then analyze them using `tria.ge` and download the corresponding pcap files and reports. Whole folder with malware samples can be analyzed or just one malware sample. The samples can be also just send to the analysis without downloading the pcap file.

## Instalation
First you need to unzip the `dataset_creator.zip` file. On Linux, use the command `unzip dataset_creator.zip`. This will create a folder with the same name, with the source files, which you need to switch to. 

Next, using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` you need to install all the necessary packages. After that, the program can be run using `python3 triage_client.py <arguments>`.

If you have your own account on `tria.ge` and want to use yours just change the variable **auth_api_key** in the file `triage_client.py` on line 13. You can find your authorization api key on this link: 
`https://tria.ge/account`. Otherwise my account with my api key will be used and you wont see the submitted samples on the `tria.ge` website.

Program was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and on Arch linux distribution.

## Usage
The **main command** is the `--all` command. This command downloads `n` number of samples for each family, then it will upload all the samples to the `tria.ge` for analysis. And 2 pcap files will be downloaded from 2 analysis for each malware sample. The pcaps for one malware have same name but different endings `_1` and `_2`.
And the it will download all the pcaps and overview reports as .json file. The file with malware families needs to have each family name on new line. And it's better to look the family name on the website `bazaar.abuse.ch` and use the name what they use, because sometimes it doesnt work if the name is a bit different. It the zip archive is exampe with 15 family names.

Next command is `--submit` command. This command is for uploading single file or whole directory to the `tria.ge` for analysis. If whole directory is uploaded then `csv` log files are created. But if only simple file is uploaded no log files are created.

Command `--download` is used for downloading all pcap from `.csv` log file. This command only works if some `.csv` files were created using command `--submit`.

And last command `--get` is used to download `n` number of samples of specified family.
