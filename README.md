# Tool for creating malware datasets

**Author:** VÃ¡clav Korvas

The tool is used to automatically download malware samples from `bazaar.abuse.ch`, then analyze them using `tria.ge` and download the corresponding pcap files and reports. Whole folder with malware samples can be analyzed or just one malware sample. The samples can be also just send to the analysis without downloading the pcap file.

## Instalation
First you need to unzip the `dataset_creator.zip` file. On Linux, use the command `unzip dataset_creator.zip`. This will create a folder with the same name, with the source files, which you need to switch to. 

Next, using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` you need to install all the necessary packages. After that, the program can be run using `python3 triage_client.py <arguments>`.

Program was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and on Arch linux distribution.
